# mocha-github-actions-reporter

This is a replica of the Mocha spec reporter that simply adds GitHub annotations to the report? Why? I thought it would be more helpful than it is, and I couldn't test it until I already made it.

See the [demo action](https://github.com/willbarkoff/mocha-github-actions-reporter/actions/workflows/demo.yml) for an example.
